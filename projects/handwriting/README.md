# *Multilayer Artificial Neural Network for classifying handwritten digits*

Artificial Neural Networks are designed to function based on concepts in learning inspired by what we know about how neurons in the human brain learn. Whereas a regular neuron communicates using ion gradients and a combination of charge and neurotransmitters between neurons, artificial neurons, better known as perceptrons take an input and apply it to an activation function defining what gets output. 

Depending on the correctness of the output value as determined by simply propagating forward, the value is back propagated through and weights from the activation function to the output are altered until the value output matches the target. 

Some (most) problems however are far too complex for a single neuron (perceptron) to solve, so by wiring them up (and a ton of tweaking) complex problems can become solvable.

There are several variations on the Artificial Neural Network, which typically involves a small number of layers, an input, hidden and output layer. One such variation, the Deep Neural Network for example, involves a great many hidden layers allowing for more neurons and weights to adjust to targets.

This final project will involve attempting to classify MNIST data using an Artificial Neural Network.
